<div class="bodystuff"><p>Learning how to shoot is one  of the most important things you can have access as a skill, when you are playing basketball.<br>
You won't need to walk up to your defender and try to score, instead you can just shoot from wherever you want to...<br>
Its that easy to say, but not to do. You will need to practice on how you can shoot a ball perfectly for it to make it<br>
in the hoop. It sounds pretty hard too, but nothing makes a human better than practice itself. You have to lift the ball,<br>
and have to make sure your superior hand is on the bottom of the ball so you will be able to give it force to go near the hoop.<br>
But for that you will also want it to go straight to the hoop, so you will put your spare hand on the left side of the ball<br> 
if you shoot from your right hand. Or you can place it on the right if you shoot from your left hand.</p></div>
